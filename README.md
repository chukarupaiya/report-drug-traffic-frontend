Drug abuse and trafficking pose significant challenges to society, leading to various negative consequences such as accidents, violence, and health issues. The existing methods for reporting drug trafficking lack anonymity and convenience for the general public. This project aims to develop a digital platform that enables anonymous reporting of drug trafficking incidents. The system will incorporate machine learning models to filter out false alarms and provide a user-friendly interface for easy reporting in multiple languages. By empowering the public to report incidents, the project seeks to contribute to the reduction of drug trafficking and create a safer and more peaceful society. This report provides an overview of the project, including the problem statement, project scope, and organization of the report. 
This project addresses the pressing issue of drug abuse and trafficking, which have detrimental effects on society. With a significant rise in drug use among teenagers and the association of drug trafficking with other forms of crime, it is crucial to establish an effective reporting system. The proposed solution allows the public to report drug trafficking anonymously, thereby encouraging greater participation from concerned individuals. By implementing machine learning models, false alarms can be minimized, ensuring that reported incidents are genuine. The system also emphasizes user-friendliness, enabling easy uploading of relevant information in various languages. The project's scope encompasses the reduction of drug trafficking in India, a country vulnerable to the illicit drugs trade. The report is structured to provide comprehensive insights into the project, including literature survey, system requirements, design, implementation, results analysis, application in society, and future work. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to a safer and more secure society by combatting drug trafficking through an efficient and anonymous reporting system.
